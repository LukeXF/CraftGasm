			<h2 class="faq">Donations</h2>
			<p>Donating to the server is a great way to gain exclusive perks and ranks while supporting the server! The CraftGasm project is far from cheap to run and develop. To continue growing the community and keep our servers online we need the support of the players. You can view all of the benefits of donating at <a href="http://store.craftgasm.net">store.craftgasm.net</a>.

			<h2 class="faq">Voting</h2>
			Voting is the second most important thing you can do to help support the server! Voting is quick, easy, and free! If you vote on all 4 sites you will gain 2500 Crystals every day! Its so easy! Also, the top 3 voters of each month will recieve a $100 voucher that can be redeemed on any thing(s) in our store. You can check the amount of votes that you have by clicking on the votes villager in the hub.

			<h2 class="faq">Nicknames</h2>
			<p>The nicknames system allows for players to change their ingame name. Every rank comes with a free nickname that can be redeemed once. Once a nickname is redeemed it cant be changed. Abuse of the nicknames system can result in a ban, or having all your nicknames deleted. Abuse includes but isnt limited to; pretending to be another player, pretending to be a rank/staff, explicit content in the nickname, ect... Use some common sense. If you want to find out the real username of a player with a nickname you can type /nick then click the emerald to reveal nicknames.</p>
